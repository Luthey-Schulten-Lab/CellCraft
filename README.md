### Java

if you didn't change the default directory to install the Minecraft, for the **Java Edition**, it should locate in the:



| OS      | Location                                         |
| :------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| Windows | `%APPDATA% \.minecraft\saves`                    |
| macOS   | `~/ Library/Application Support/minecraft/saves` |
| Linux   | `~/.minecraft/saves`                             |

The Windows location in the table above is just the default case. Launchers can set the .minecraft at any path.

If you're a Windows user and are unfamiliar with how to find your appdata folder, follow these steps:

1. Click Start → Run. If you don't see "Run", press ⊞ Windows + R.
2. Type `%APPDATA%\.minecraft` and click "OK".

If you're a Mac user, you can open the folder through Spotlight:

1. Open Finder and press ⇧ Shift + ⌘ Command + G or open the Spotlight popup through the magnifying glass icon on the right of the Menu Bar.
2. Type `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft` and hit ↵ Enter.

On Linux or macOS, the `~` in the path refers to the home directory. Folders starting with a `.` are hidden by default. In most file managers, hitting Ctrl + H toggles their hidden status. In macOS specifically, since version 10.12 (Sierra), the shortcut ⌘ Command + ⇧ Shift + . toggles the hidden status of files.
